Thanks for Mr unknown, who today taught me a vey useful method to learn -- The rain game 

there 4 advantages for this:

1. build my vocabulary
2. exercise my writing skills
3. enhance my subject understanding
4. train my imagination

Actually, I think it is the same thing as '' to learn, to teach ''. But the former is to write and the later is more apt to speak. Under normal circumstances, it is more easy for me(us) to practice as the first way.
